Problem L - Sauna

Kaisa and her friends are going to the sauna!

Now they have to pick the temperature. Each of them has their own temperature
preferences as an inclusive range of acceptable values. Can you help them find
the temperatures that everyone is happy with?

Since there might be a large number of possible temperatures, they have asked
you to just tell them how many options there are and what the lowest
temperature that works for everyone is, as then the sauna will need less time
to heat up.

Input:
------
The first line of input contains an integer, N, the number of people in the 
group (2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5). The next N lines each contain two integers, ai and bi, 
indicating that the ith person’s temperature preference is between ai and bi, 
inclusive. Temperatures are given in millidegrees Celsius, with
0 ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤ 2 * 10^5.

Output:
-------
Output two integers: first, the number of different temperatures (in
millidegrees Celsius) that fit all preferences; and second, the lowest such
value.

If there are no values that fit all preferences, instead output "bad news".

Explanation for sample input 1:
--------------------------------
There are three possible temperatures that all three people will be happy with:
70003, 70004, 70005.

Sample Input 1:
---------------
3
70000 70005
70003 70010
65000 80000

Sample Output 1:
----------------
3 70003

Sample Input 2:
---------------
2
70000 70500
80000 80100

Sample Output 2:
----------------
bad news
